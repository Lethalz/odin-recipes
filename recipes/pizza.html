            <h1>Pepperoni Pizza</h1>

             <img src="images/pizza.jpeg" alt="Pizza">

            <p>Smells like melted mozzarella cheese.
                dripping on the side of the plate.
                The pepperoni smells like spicy wasabi.
                I can see pepperoni faces that are happy,
                and the cheese looks shiny,
                the dough peeking out the side.</p>

                
                <h2> Ingredients </h2>

                <h2> Quick Pizza Sauce </h2>
                
                <ul>

                    <li> 1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt) </li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic </li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion </li>
                    <li> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
                    <li> 1 teaspoon olive oil </li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3> Steps</h3>
                
                <ol> 
                  
                  <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; 
                    set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
                  <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
                    Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
                  <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. 
                    Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
                  <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
                  <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
                  <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>               
                </ol>
