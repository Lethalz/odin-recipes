        <p> Ackee and Saltfish is one of the traditional Caribbean dishes. Just like a tomato, the Ackee is a member of the fruit family, but it can also be used as a vegetable. Ackee has a creamy texture, and has a delicate feel to it, similar to eggs. It also has a rather bitter aftertaste.</p>

        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
         
        <ul> 
            <li>A can of fresh ackee</li>
            <li>1/3 pounds of boneless and skinless saltfish</li>
            <li>1 finely chopped scotch bonnet pepper</li>
            <li> Fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 cubed medium tomato</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 scallions</li>
            <li>¼ chopped sweet bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon tomato paste</li>
           
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Begin by boiling the salted fish in a pot on high heat, then simmer for 15 minutes. If you want, you can soak the saltfish in cold water overnight before you begin boiling it.</li>
            <li>Once you’re done boiling, drain the water, rinse the fish in cold water, and then squeeze it dry.</li>
            <li>Break the fish into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Next, open up the can of ackee, place everything in a strainer, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>Heat some olive oil in a pan, then sauté the thyme, scotch bonnet pepper, garlic, tomato and onions, and scallions together for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the cod and tomato paste. Stir and simmer for an additional five minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the drained ackee, but do not stir since you don’t want the ackee to break into pieces.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with black pepper, and serve.</li>

        </ol>
